# Simple-group-chat-

Project: -

1. When the user hits url ==> "/login" .A form will appear to the user to enter his username.

2. Once the user enters the username it will store in the browser's local storage. 

3. Redirect the user to url ==> "/" and show him the send message form.

4. Once the user sends a message  it will store in the file such as "username": "message", so that we have an idea who sent the message.

5. While reading the message from the file now we can see who sent the message.

6. Now open another tab in incognito and login via a different username. On sending message now this application works like a group chat.Congratulations!!!!
